This could be caused by friction, possibly due to ill-fitting shoes or repetitive rubbing during activities. It might also be related to a burn, an allergic reaction, or a skin condition. If the blister is painful, infected, or persistent, it's advisable to consult a healthcare professional for a proper evaluation. They can assess whether it's a simple blister or if there's an underlying condition that needs attention. In the meantime, keeping the area clean and avoiding further irritation can help. If you notice signs of infection, such as increased redness, swelling, or pus, seeking medical advice promptly is recommended.",.gradio\flagged\Doctors Voice Response\95768da6a0cf873680b5\doctor_response.mp3,,2025-04-27 18:36:59.406100
